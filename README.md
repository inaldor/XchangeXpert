# XchangeXpert
An exchange rates app

## About
This app aims to keep the user informed about the latest exchange rates of a chosen pair of currencies. The user can choose as many currency pairs as he wants and the app will request and update currency rates every second using an API. The app doesn't use any third-party libraries or frameworks. To persist the data in the app I used UserDefaults.

## Features
* Add a pair of currencies, the base currency first and then the quote currency
* Delete a pair of currencies
* Fast and consistent data management, to give the user the right information, every second
* Good coverage on Tests, Integration and Unit(TODO)
* A widget to inform the user about a featured pair of currencies(TODO)
